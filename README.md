# eSave
Mobile Android application that acts as a way to keep track of the amount of money you currently have within your bank account.<br/>
The purpose of this application was to up-skill myself by learning how to write an android application.<br/>
The application does not work to the full extent as to what I imagined but it does however have the core functions:<br/>
- keeping track of money within your money.
- allows you to add money
- remove money within a certain category on a budget that gets set up.

## What I Learned
- I learned how to save settings on an android device
- How Android studio works and what is needed to code in the environment
- Learnt how to create menus
- And the importance of efficiency and how tiny adjustments can impact hugely

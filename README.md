# eSave
Mobile Android application that acts as a way to keep track of the amount of money you currently have within your bank account.<br/>
The purpose of this application was to up-skill myself by learning how to write an android application.<br/>
The application does not work to the full extent as to what I imagined but it does however have the core functions:<br/>
- keeping track of money (However this is still a manual process)
- allows you to add money
- remove money as an expense within a certain category on a budget that gets set up.

## What I Learned
- I learned how to save settings on an android device
- How Android studio works what is needed and how to code in the environment
- Learnt how to create menus
- And the importance of efficiency and how tiny adjustments can impact hugely
